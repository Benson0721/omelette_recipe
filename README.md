## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- PostCss-Postprocessor
- Mobile-first workflow
- Scss


### What I learned

It is My first time to use something like PostCss to help me sorting css properties,
and through this practise, I found my misunderstanding about css unit-vh and %, 
I spend sometime to overcome the problem of layout problem.
It was a very precious experience for me!

### Continued development

Since I finally finish the first progress of the Mentor challenge,
I want to do more practise about javascript!
I already have basic concept for that, but still not practise enough!
